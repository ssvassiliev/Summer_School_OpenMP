Calculating total electrostatic potential energy of a set of charges is a common problem in molecular simulations. To compute it we need to sum interactions between all pairs of charges:

$$ E = \frac{charge_i*charge_j}{distance_{i,j}}$$

Start with the following boilerplate:
~~~
/* --- File elect_energy.c --- */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	struct timespec ts_start, ts_end;
	int size = 20;
	int n_charges = size*size*size;
	float scale=0.5;
	float *charge, *x, *y, *z;
	float **M;
	int i,j,k;
	float time_total;

	charge=malloc(n_charges*sizeof(float));
	x=malloc(n_charges*sizeof(float));
	y=malloc(n_charges*sizeof(float));
	z=malloc(n_charges*sizeof(float));
	M=(float**)malloc(n_charges*sizeof(float*));
	for (i=0;i<n_charges;i++)
		M[i]=malloc(n_charges*sizeof(float));

/* initialize x,y,z coordinates and charges */
	int n=0;
	for (i=0; i<size; i++)
		for (j=0; j<size; j++)
			for (k=0; k<size; k++) {
				x[n]=i*scale;
				y[n]=j*scale;
				z[n]=k*scale;
				charge[n]=0.33;
				n++;
			}
	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_start);


	// Calculate electrostatic energy: sum of charge[i]*charge[j]/dist[i,j] */
	float dx, dy, dz, dist;
	double Energy=0.0f;

/* Loop calculating  Energy = charge[i]*charge[j]/dist[i,j] */

	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts_end);
	time_total = (ts_end.tv_sec - ts_start.tv_sec)*1000000000 + (ts_end.tv_nsec - ts_start.tv_nsec);
	printf("\nTotal time is %f ms, Energy is %f\n", time_total/1000000, Energy);
}

This code generates a set of charges placed at the nodes of the cubic grid. The grid spacing is defined by the *scale* variable.

1. Write the loop computing sum of all pairwise electrostatic interactions. Recollect that because $E_{ij}=E_{ji}$ we need to compute only half of all interactions.
2. First, compile and run the program without OpenMP. Note how long it took to run. A millisecond is not enough to get good performance measurements.
3. Next, increase the `size` to 30 and recompile. Check the run time. Try with the size = 40.

Now comes the parallelization.

## The schedule() clause

OpenMP loop directives (`parallel for, parallel do`) can take several other clauses besides the `private()` clause we've already seen. One is `schedule()`, which allows us to specify how loop iterations are divided up among the
threads.

The default is *static* scheduling, in which all iterations are allocated to threads before they execute any loop iterations.

In *dynamic* scheduling, only some of the iterations are allocated to threads at the beginning of the loop's execution. Threads that complete their iterations are then eligible to get additional work. The allocation process continues until all the iterations have been distributed to threads.

There's a tradeoff between overhead (i.e., how much time is spent setting up the schedule) and load balancing (i.e., how much time is spent waiting for the most heavily-worked thread to catch up). Static scheduling has low overhead but
may be badly balanced; dynamic scheduling has higher overhead.

Both scheduling types also take a *chunk size*; larger chunks mean less overhead and greater memory locality, smaller chunks may mean finer load balancing. You can omit the chunk size, it defaults to 1 for *dynamic* schedule and to $N_{iterrations}/{N_{threads}}$ for *static* schedule.

Bad load balancing might be what's causing this code not to parallelize very well. As we are computing triangular part of the interaction matrix *static* scheduling with the default *chunk size* will lead to uneven load.

Let's add a `schedule(dynamic)` or `schedule(static,100)` clause and see what happens.

> ## Play with the schedule() clause
>
> Try different `schedule()` clauses and tabulate the run times with different thread numbers. What seems to work best for this problem?
>
> Does it change much if you grow the problem size? That is, if you make `size` bigger?
>
> There's a third option, `guided`, which starts with large chunks and gradually decreases the chunk size as it works through the iterations.
> Try it out too, if you like. With `schedule(guided,<chunk>)`, the chunk parameter is the smallest chunk size it will try.
