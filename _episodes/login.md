#### Communication costs

1. Mixed feelings about Jupyter and Dask Client thingie... While it is good to show these features ... the way you used them I feel disconnected your presentation with students experience because you were using programs that they could not use and they were not able to reproduce your actions.
   Not easy to set them up so that they would be able to run these programs on cluster ... Possible at all? Worth it?

2. Presentation when you were setting up exercises - Too much jumping between windows and showing only terminal or only document at a time. it would help to organize presentation so that you would have a tiled window so that they would have exercise questions, instructions and terminal side by side.


3. Exercise - Taking code from a temporary shared document in not optimal. Code should be available on a webpage, and/or as files. It was a last minute fix.

4. FYI Formatting issues after pasting code from a document can be fixed in vi in one simple command: gg=G. Vi does a wonderful job with automatic indentation!

5. How would they evaluate their jobs, how to benchmark them?

5. Python - 4 spaces? Not neccessrary!

6. Crash course for C?
